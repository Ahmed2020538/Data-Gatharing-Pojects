# Data-Gatharing-Pojects :: 
************************************
* That Repo include Data Collecting and Gatharing Projects Such as ::
    * Apply Sql quaries on Databases to extract data from It.
    * Scrapping data from Diffirent Web-site and Use Beautiful soup Package To Make Python Understaning The html,Css response.
    * Useing WEB-API-Services For Gatharing data From Social Media Platforms.



# Data Collection Definition ::
****************************************

* Data collection is defined as the procedure of collecting, measuring and analyzing accurate insights for research using standard validated techniques. A researcher can evaluate their hypothesis on the basis of collected data. In most cases, data collection is the primary and most important step for research, irrespective of the field of research. The approach of data collection is different for different fields of study, depending on the required information.

* The most critical objective of data collection is ensuring that information-rich and reliable data is collected for statistical analysis so that data-driven decisions can be made for research.  



# Types of Data Collection :: 
************************
* Before broaching the subject of the various types of data collection. It is pertinent to note that data collection in itself falls under two broad categories; Primary data collection and secondary data collection.




* Qualitative Research Method  ::
    * The qualitative research methods of data collection do not involve the collection of data that involves numbers or a need to be deduced through a mathematical calculation, rather it is based on the non-quantifiable elements like the feeling or emotion of the researcher. An example of such a method is an open-ended questionnaire.


* Quantitative Method ::
    * Quantitative methods are presented in numbers and require a mathematical calculation to deduce. An example would be the use of a questionnaire with close-ended questions to arrive at figures to be calculated Mathematically. Also, methods of correlation and regression, mean, mode and median.

# IMPORTANCE OF DATA COLLECTION ::
**********************************
* There are a bunch of underlying reasons for collecting data, especially for a researcher. Walking you through them, here are a few reasons; 


* Integrity of the Research ::
    * A key reason for collecting data, be it through quantitative or qualitative methods is to ensure that the integrity of the research question is indeed maintained.

* Reduce the likelihood of errors ::
    * The correct use of appropriate data collection of methods reduces the likelihood of errors consistent with the results. 

* Decision Making ::
    * To minimize the risk of errors in decision-making, it is important that accurate data is collected so that the researcher doesn't make uninformed decisions. 

* Save Cost and Time ::
    * Data collection saves the researcher time and funds that would otherwise be misspent without a deeper understanding of the topic or subject matter.

* To support a need for a new idea, change, and/or innovation
* To prove the need for a change in the norm or the introduction of new information that will be widely accepted, it is important to collect data as evidence to support these claims.
